🚀 Unlocking Audience Favorites: Popularity Analysis 📊

In a data-driven world, knowing what people love is the secret sauce. I recently dove into a captivating project during my virtual internship in the "Data Analytics and Visualization" program, offered by Accenture on Forage.

🔍 Step 1: Merging Data
I started by bringing together three sets of information. The reactions dataset told me how people felt, the content dataset showed what sparked those feelings, and the reaction type dataset gave scores.

🧐 Step 2: Grouping by Category
I grouped everything by category and added up the scores. This allowed me to see which categories truly struck a chord with our audience.

💥 Step 3: Top 5 Categories
The results were eye-opening! By examining the scores, I pinpointed the Top 5 Categories that our audience couldn't get enough of. These were the topics that sparked the most interest.

🏆 Why It Matters
Understanding what resonates with our audience empowers me to create content that truly connects. I can focus on what matters most to them and supercharge engagement.

🔍 Stay Tuned for More Insights
Keep an eye out for more fascinating insights from this project. I'll delve deeper into what makes these Top 5 Categories shine.

🚀 Let's Connect and Collaborate
I'm always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts. If you're interested in discussing data analysis, insights, or potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out.

🙏 Thank You
A big thank you to the incredible team behind this project, and to all of you for your support. Together, I'm turning data into actionable insights that drive success.
